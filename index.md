# Inspiration

One day, Dr. Altenberg appeared in the ICSpace with a thought.  Thinking out loud, he said: "Wouldn't it be great if we could start an ICSpace band playing all sorts of music in here?"  He loved his classical music and knew how to play a myriad of instruments, but he didn't know anyone he could start a band with. And that's how our idea of Musicians of Manoa, started.

# About

Musicians of Manoa allows local musicians in the Manoa area to meet and hold jam sessions.  Users can post events and find other musicians to perform with.  Users can also filter through profiles based on instruments, musical tastes, skills, and goals, as well as give Musicians a rating.

# Application design

We designed the application to be straighforward. You can sign up and log in to your own profile. You can edit your profile to include your musical capabilities. There is a browsing page where you can see everyone that has signed up. There is a page for "jam sessions." Jam sessions are posted events where people are free to attend to jam out with other musicians. Overall, this app intends to give users a way to find other musicians and meet up with them.
