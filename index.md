# Inspiration

One day, Dr. Altenberg appeared in the ICSpace with a thought.  Thinking out loud, he said: "Wouldn't it be great if we could start an ICSpace band playing all sorts of music in here?"  He loved his classical music and knew how to play a myriad of instruments, but he didn't know anyone he could start a band with. And that's how our idea of Musicians of Manoa, started.

# About

Musicians of Manoa allows local musicians in the Manoa area to meet and hold jam sessions.  Users can post events to find other musicians to perform with.  Users can also filter through profiles to find fellow musicians based on instruments, musical tastes, skills, and goals, as well as give Musicians a rating.
