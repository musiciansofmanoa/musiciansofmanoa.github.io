# Inspiration

One day, Dr. Altenberg appeared in the ICSpace with a thought.  Thinking out loud, he said: "Wouldn't it be great if we could start an ICSpace band playing all sorts of music in here?"  He loved his classical music and knew how to play a myriad of instruments, but he didn't know anyone he could start a band with. And that's how our idea of Musicians of Manoa, started.

# About

Musicians of Manoa allows local musicians in the Manoa area to meet and hold jam sessions.  Users can post events and find other musicians to perform with.  Users can also filter through profiles based on instruments, musical tastes, skills, and goals, as well as give Musicians a rating.

# Application design

We designed the application to be straight forward and easy to use. You can sign up or log in to your own profile. You can edit your profile to include your musical capabilities, goals, and contact information. There is a browsing page where you can see other musicians, as well as a filter that allows you to view profiles by music genre, instruments, etc. The Jam Sessions page shows posted events where people are free to attend to jam out with other musicians. Overall, the app's design was kept simple and clean to make the process of meeting fellow musicians in the Manoa area easier.  

# Development history

Milestone 1 (11/15/18): Mockup and basic functionality implemented.

Milestone 2 (11/29/18): Increased functionality of multiple pages. Added exclusive admin page.

### Milestone 1: Mock up development

For Milestone 1 the initial mock up images were changed and implemented into the app with limited functionality. 

[Github Milestone 1](https://github.com/musiciansofmanoa/musiciansofmanoa/projects/2) 

### Milestone 2

For Milestone 2 we implemented more functionality into the different pages.  There is an admin page that allows the admin to view any profile in the system as well as delete any user for misconduct.  Adjustments to the navbar and footer were made to work smoother.  A temporary database was also created for the app.  Progress was made on building the Jam Sessions page and User Profile page.

### Milestone 3

For Milestone 3, current issues being worked on are the User Profile page as well as the Jam Sessions page.  The Graphic design of the app will be updated as well.
